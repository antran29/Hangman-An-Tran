List of changes made to code:

1. Added Difficulty Selection (Easy and Hard Modes):

Introduced a difficulty screen with "Easy" and "Hard" buttons.
Based on user choice, the number of mistakes allowed (max mistakes) is set to 5 (Easy) or 3 (Hard).

5/3/25
2. Resized and Centered Buttons:

Adjusted the size and positioning of the buttons (Easy, Hard, Restart, Quit) to ensure they are centered in their respective areas.

10/3/25
3. Restart and Quit Options after Win/Loss:

After winning or losing, a screen with two buttons ("Restart" and "Quit") was added.
These buttons were centered inside their respective colored boxes (green for restart and red for quit).
Clicking "Restart" resets the game, and "Quit" closes the game.

4. Added Hint Button:

Introduced a "Hint" button that is placed on the left side of the screen.
The hint reveals one letter from the word (if the button is clicked) and disappears after it is used once.
The hint button reappears when the game is restarted.

17/3/25
5. Game Initialization and Setup:

Added initialization for the game, including window setup, fonts, and button variables.
The pygame.init() function was called to set up Pygame components.

21/3/25
6.Improved Button Layout and Centering:

Buttons were adjusted to be positioned in such a way that they would not overlap or get cut off, improving visual organization.
The text inside buttons was aligned to the center for better aesthetics.

7. Added Input Handling for Hint and Restart/Quit Options:

Handling input for the Hint button to ensure it is only available once per game.
Correct logic added to handle clicks on the "Restart" and "Quit" buttons.

22/3/25
8. Game State Reset after Restart:

When the user clicks the "Restart" button, the game variables (such as the guessed letters, hangman status, and selected word) are reset.
The game continues from the difficulty screen after restarting.

29/3/25
9. Added More Comments for Clarity:

Comments were added throughout the code to explain the function of each part, such as the initialization, event handling, and game logic.

10. PEP 8 Compliance:

Adjusted the code to follow PEP 8 standards, including consistent indentation, line length, and spacing.

11. Hints Mechanism:

A new game mechanic was added for the hint button to give players a clue about the word they are trying to guess.
30/3/25
12. Ensured All Buttons and Elements are Positioned Correctly:

Used appropriate spacing to make sure buttons don't overlap with each other or game elements (like letters or images).

13. Game Loop Adjustments:

The main game loop was modified to handle difficulty selection, hint usage, and restart functionality smoothly.

14. Added Restart Logic After Losing or Winning:

When the game ends (either through winning or losing), the player has the option to restart the game or quit, with the buttons appearing on the screen.
